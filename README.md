# Music

A self-hosted **music player and tabletop-session orchestrator**. One person (the GM/DM)
drives playback from any device; audio comes out of one or more output devices — a laptop,
a TV in the room, a headless box wired to a speaker. The server is the single source of
truth for *what should be playing right now*; every client reconciles to it.

Built as a single FastAPI process that serves both the JSON API and the React SPA from one
origin. SQLite for state, the filesystem for the music library, YAML for campaign content.

> Single-operator app, designed to run on a home server behind a reverse proxy. It is **not**
> multi-tenant — there is one account, the operator's.

## Features

- **Filesystem-driven library** — your folder tree under `MUSIC_DIR` *is* the library. Drag in
  a file or a whole album folder; tags are read via [mutagen], with a filename/parent-folder
  fallback. The index is a materialised view of the tree, rebuilt on boot and on upload.
- **Server-as-reducer playback** — the server holds the canonical `PlayerState`, owns the
  playback clock (`position_ms` is live in every push), and advances the queue itself at end of
  track; clients follow state and seek only when `position_epoch` changes. Repeat, shuffle,
  crossfade, and a graphic-EQ effect chain are all there.
- **Multi-device output** — any connected browser tab (or headless client) can be switched on as
  a live speaker, each with its own volume trim. A device can be saved as "output by default" so
  it auto-activates when it reconnects.
- **TV / room display** — a read-only now-playing view at `/` for a screen in the room, usable
  **without logging in** (guest access), with cover art, up-next, and recently-played.
- **Compatibility mode** — a dependency-free ES5 fallback player (`compat-mode.js`) for browsers
  that can't run the SPA (old smart TVs). Loads via `<script nomodule>` or a boot watchdog when
  the bundle fails to run; previewable on any browser with `?compat`. Same output protocol,
  plain `<audio>` + XHR/WebSocket.
- **Modes** — top-level campaign bundles (theme + soundboards + cues + EQ presets), authored as
  on-disk YAML and hot-reloadable.
- **Soundboards** — fire-and-forget SFX, with keyboard hotkeys, broadcast to every active output.
- **Cues** — one-click saved setups: apply an EQ preset, start a playlist from a chosen
  song + timestamp, fire one-shot SFX, and start looping SFX, all from one button.
- **Interrupts** — briefly take over playback for an alert/stinger, either pausing the music or
  *ducking* it under the interrupt with configurable fade in/out.
- **External outputs** — anything that can play an HTTP stream can be an audio output, with no
  server changes and no login. See [`clients/`](clients/README.md) for the protocol and a
  ready-to-run headless appliance.

## Quick start (Docker)

The repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Node build of the SPA → Python runtime serving both
the API and the static bundle on port 8000). All state lives under `/data`, so a single bind
mount persists everything.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t music .

# Run it — one bind mount for music/, sfx/, modes/, and app.db
docker run -d --name music \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -v /srv/music-data:/data \
  music

# Create the operator account (password prompts interactively)
docker exec -it music music-cli create-user admin
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` and sign in. A fresh install boots fine with **zero** audio
files — drop music in through the Library tab (or straight into `/srv/music-data/music`).

The image is also built and pushed to GHCR by CI on every push to `main`; the production
rollout itself is handled by a separate infra repository.

## Configuration

Set via environment variables (see [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example)). The
Dockerfile pre-sets the storage paths under `/data`, so for a containerised run you typically
only need `SECRET_KEY`.

| Variable | Required | Default (in image) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | **yes** | — | Session signing key, **≥ 32 chars** |
| `MUSIC_DIR` | | `/data/music` | Root of the scanned music library |
| `SFX_LIBRARY_DIR` | | `/data/sfx` | Root for soundboard SFX files |
| `MODES_DIR` | | `/data/modes` | On-disk mode bundles (seeded on first boot) |
| `DEVICES_FILE` | | `/data/devices.json` | Remembered output-device registry |
| `DATABASE_URL` | | `sqlite:////data/app.db` | App DB (auth, playlists, indexed tracks) |
| `STATIC_DIR` | | `/app/static` | Built SPA served at `/` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | | — | CORS origins (only needed for split dev) |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` / `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | | | Cookie hardening for HTTPS deploys |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | | `info` | Log verbosity |

There are no migrations: the schema is created idempotently on boot, and new additive columns
are applied automatically. Incompatible schema changes mean wiping `app.db` and re-creating the
user — the persistent state worth keeping is your auth account and playlists (the track index is
regenerable from the filesystem).

## Development

Backend (Python 3.11+) and frontend (Node 20) run as two processes in dev.

```bash
# Backend — uv-managed (uv.lock is the pinned resolution)
cd backend
uv sync --extra dev                                  # creates .venv from uv.lock
cp .env.example .env                                 # set SECRET_KEY (≥32 chars)
uv run music-cli create-user admin
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload                 # http://localhost:8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                                          # http://localhost:5173, proxies to the API
```

No `uv`? `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"` works
too — you just won't get the locked versions.

Checks:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv run pytest                                        # tests
uv run ruff check app tests                          # lint
uv run mypy app tests                                # types

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test                                         # vitest
npm run build
```

## Architecture

```
backend/   FastAPI app. The sync package (app/sync/) is the authority: state-mutating
           actions funnel through commit_and_broadcast → a state machine → DB persistence +
           a WebSocket broadcast. HTTP handlers that mutate state route through the same funnel.
           Two auth tiers: most endpoints require a session; the player/stream/cover endpoints
           accept guests so a logged-out TV tab can act as an output.
frontend/  React + TypeScript (Vite). A Web Audio engine (ambient crossfade + interrupt lane +
           a preset effect chain) reconciles to PlayerState pushed over the WebSocket.
modes/     On-disk campaign bundles, baked into the image as a seed and copied to MODES_DIR on
           first boot. Everything authored is per-mode — playlists, soundboards, cues, EQ presets.
clients/   The documented guest output protocol + a reference headless appliance.
```

- **The library never moves files implicitly.** Moves, renames, and deletes happen only as
  explicit API actions, and the index follows.
- **Single process, one origin.** `/api/*` and the SPA share a host; the SPA falls back to
  client-side routing.
- **Unhandled exceptions return JSON** with the error class + message — a single-user debug aid.
